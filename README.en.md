<h2>How can I register my domain name in Medium DNS?</h2>

[Create issue](https://github.com/medium-isp/medium-dns/issues) with name that you would like to register (like [medium.isp](https://medium.isp)).

Remember that each host is checked for availability at least once every 24 hours. If your host will not answer after 3 attempts in 15 minutes interval, it will be removed from DNS.
