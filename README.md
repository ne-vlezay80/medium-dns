<h2>How can I add my domain name to this list?</h2>

[Create issue](https://github.com/medium-isp/medium-dns/issues) and specify your host b32 and b64 addresses. Each host is checked for availability at least once every 24 hours. If your host will not answer after 3 attempts in 15 minutes interval, it will be removed from list.
